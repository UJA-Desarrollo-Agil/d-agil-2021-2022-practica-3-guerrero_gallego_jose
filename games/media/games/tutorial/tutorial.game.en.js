        <p>Welcome to the Undum tutorial. Undum is a tool for writing\
        hypertext interactive fiction. It has some unique features\

        \
        <p>Hypertext interactive fiction is the digital equivalent of the\
        Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) books that were popular in the\
        1980s. The story is told in chunks, and you select from a range\
        of options to move it forward. Unlike the book form, however, the\
        digital form gives you far more flexibility to tell rich stories\
        and introduce more interesting game elements.</p>\
